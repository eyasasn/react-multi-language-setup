By providing content in multiple languages, a web app can reach a wider audience and create a more inclusive and welcoming experience for users who may prefer to consume content in their native language. This can lead to increased engagement, customer satisfaction, and ultimately, business success. Additionally, having a multi-language web app can help companies expand their reach into new markets and tap into new opportunities for growth. Overall, offering a multi-language experience is not only important for accommodating diverse users but also for enhancing the overall user experience and expanding the reach of the web app."
